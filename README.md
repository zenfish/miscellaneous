Some rough bits that don't go anywhere else
--------------------------------------------

https - a little python web SSL server... used it for testing some
of my cert stuff.  Lots of these out there, this is mine for now.

f-u-openssl - a quick way to generate a CA, server cert, and host
certs for openvpn and https and all that.  Oh, openssl, how I detest thee.
