Create a CA, a server cert suitable for https/vpn, and a client
cert for vpn/whatever. Sticks them all in a subdir called "certitude".

   Usage: ./rot-in-hell.sh

Probably done the wrong way. It seems to work.  I hate openssl.
And openvpn. And pgp. And ssh. Crypto in general kinda blows.


-> Based on the easy rsa cert stuff <-


A haiku to openssl:

    openssl
    a black crane over the lake
    may you rot in hell
